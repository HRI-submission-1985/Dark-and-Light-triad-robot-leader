# Dark-and-Light-triad-robot-leader

This repository contains the code and supporting materials for a research study investigating how leadership styles influence dynamics within human-robot teams. The project explored two contrasting leadership styles: 

- **Dark Triad** (reflecting Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy)
- **Light Triad** (reflecting humanism, Kantianism and faith in humanity)

The leadership styles were embodied by a robot leader during a collaborative tower-building task. 

The robot's leadership style was manipulated through its communication style, including time reminders, instructions, motivational statements, and responses to team dynamics. The study examined how contrasting leadership styles affect human-robot team interactions and leadership effectiveness.
